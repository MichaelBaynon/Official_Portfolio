              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Mystery Dog</b> is my most recent project and representation of my work.
              This is a personal project that was made for my dog.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since this was a personal project I did everything completely on my own. So I have both a front end and a backend.
              The Front End utilizes JavaScript, ReactJS, and CSS for the backend I used JavaScript again with NodeJS, express.js, knex.js, and SQL.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aim for this site was ease of use. I aimed to make a site that was both good looking and easy to navigate. At the time of
              writing this the sites main features are the home page, register, login, and two pages both called "Inspiration" and "Creator". The "Dogs" page is still a work in progress but my end goal is a page where you can post, edit, comment on, and delete the different dog postings.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was done using ReactJS, and
              vanilla CSS. This project was done for an insurance consulting
              company it was basically a modern touch up of their older site
              from the early 2000s.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working on the <b>EBCG </b> website was
              very fun because I had complete creative freedom and I actaully
              had the opportunity to do some photo editing and UI/UX.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this project I showed my
              understanding of the Front End proccess, my ability to work
              directly with a client, and my on the spot creativity.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similiar to the EBCG project the website
              for SHOPBTI was done using ReactJS. This is a technology company
              and therefore demanded a little more finesse.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made this site mobile first and then
              came in at the end adding some desktop styling and unique
              features. Similiar to the EBCG project I also had a lot of
              creative freedom here besides the text so the design was made
              entirely by me.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this project I demonstrated my
              ability to make cross platform applications that are responsive
              and functional. I used React Router to route between specific
              pages making the tranisitions virtually seamless.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; College Value was built using React on

              Sign Out, and much more. In this project I demonstrate my
              understanding of protected routes, authentication, and the Front

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How To - life hacks</b> is also a
              project I take good pride in. Mostly because I built an entire
              nodeJS backend entirely by myself and from scratch. Of course this
              project posed challenges of its own but this project has proven to
              be one of if not my best learning experience so far.

            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was personally responsible for the

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Guidr</b> is one of those projects
              that I am a little less excited to show only because we had a lot
              of team members so I wouldn't want you to receive the wrong
              impression of my code.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My specific code in my branch is linked
              below so you can always check there for specifics. In general I
              contributed to this project with styling, login and signup
              functionality, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three specifics things I wanted to
              highlight were that one this idea was very new so new ideas were
              essential and I was involved in the beginning discussion of what
              this app could be. Two we had no one available to do the UI/UX so
              me and one other team member stepped up and spent late nights
              writing code and then completing the UI/UX needs. Finally three,
              probaly most important, teamwork. At that current time I had never
              worked with a group that large which was a fun and interesting
              challenge which I feel I handled very well.
