              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project was done using ReactJS, and vanilla CSS. This project was done for an insurance consulting company it was basically a modern touch up of their older site from the early 2000s.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working on the <b>EBCG </b> website was very fun because I had complete creative freedom and I actaully had the opportunity to do some photo editing and UI/UX.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this project I showed my understanding of the Front End proccess, my ability to work directly with a client, and my on the spot creativity.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Similiar to the EBCG project the website for SHOPBTI was done using ReactJS. This is a technology company and therefore demanded a little more finesse. 
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I made this site mobile first and then came in at the end adding some desktop styling and unique features. Similiar to the EBCG project I also had a lot of creative freedom here besides the text so the design was made entirely by me.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this project I demonstrated my ability to make cross platform applications that are responsive and functional. I used React Router to route between specific pages making the tranisitions virtually seamless.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How To - life hacks</b> is also a

              nodeJS backend entirely by myself and from scratch. Of course this
              project posed challenges of its own but this project has proven to
              be one of if not my best learning experience so far.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was personally responsible for the

              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Guidr</b> is one of those projects
              that I am a little less excited to show only because we had a lot
              of team members so I wouldn't want you to receive the wrong
              impression of my code.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My specific code in my branch is linked
              below so you can always check there for specifics. In general I
              contributed to this project with styling, login and signup
              functionality, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three specifics things I wanted to
              highlight were that one this idea was very new so new ideas were
              essential and I was involved in the beginning discussion of what
              this app could be. Two we had no one available to do the UI/UX so
              me and one other team member stepped up and spent late nights
              writing code and then completing the UI/UX needs. Finally three,
              probaly most important, teamwork. At that current time I had never
              worked with a group that large which was a fun and interesting
              challenge which I feel I handled very well.

      <h3>Personal Bio</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My code journey started with just a genuine
        interest in computers and how they work. When I realized software
        development was something I could do I never looked back. I did not want
        to jump blind in so I did a lot of research like I mean A LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My initial plan was to be self taught. That
        worked for a while and I learned a lot, working on my own was no
        problem. Then I realized there is almost no way someone is not teaching
        this and my time could be better spent just learning instead of having
        to figure out what to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I found a coding bootcamp called
        Lambda School. Within a few days I was blown away with their track
        record and signed up. I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development
        course and let me tell you. Never have I ever learned so much so fast. I
        spent 5 days a week for months learning code, talking about code, and
        essentially becoming a web developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im glad I found Lambda. If it wasnt for Lambda I
        may have never became a Full Stack Developer. Lambda taught me how to
        work in team and communicate. They taught me version control and how to
        learn from others. Throughout my Lambda journey I worked in my groups
        both small and big. I also had a daily standup of what I achieved that
        day and what we were to expect for the rest of the day. I beleive this
        has prepared me for just about any workplace.

        much ambition as me.
