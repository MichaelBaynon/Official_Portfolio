      <h4>Personal Contribution</h4>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a preface to the rest of my projects most of
        these projects were made in no more then a week by me and a group of
        others. That being said any small bugs or mistypes/errors are to be
        expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>College Value</b> is definitely the project
        as of now that I take most pride in. College Value was built using React
        on the Front End and we connected to a Java Back End made by one of my
        fellow students.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was personally responsible for the styling
        and functionality of the Navigation Bar, Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out, and
        much more. In this project I demonstrate my understanding of protected
        routes, authentication, and the Front End proccess.

      <h4>Personal Contribution</h4>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How To - life hacks</b> is also a project I
        take good pride in. Mostly because I built an entire nodeJS backend
        entirely by myself and from scratch. Of course this project posed
        challenges of its own but this project has proven to be one of if not my
        best learning experience so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was personally responsible for the entire
        backend. So I made endpoints for logging in, logging out and creating
        posts, as well as a couple other smaller things which can be found on
        the site found below.

      </a>
      <h4>Personal Contribution</h4>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Guidr</b> is one of those projects that I am
        a little less excited to show only because we had a lot of team members
        so I wouldn't want you to receive the wrong impression of my code.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My specific code in my branch is linked below
        so you can always check there for specifics. In general I contributed to
        this project with styling, login and signup functionality, and more. The
        three specifics things I wanted to highlight were that one this idea was
        very new so new ideas were essential and I was involved in the beginning
        discussion of what this app could be. Two we had no one available to do
        the UI/UX so me and one other team member stepped up and spent late nights
        writing code and then completing the UI/UX needs. Finally three, probaly
        most important, teamwork. At that current time I had never worked with a
        group that large which was a fun and interesting challenge which I feel
        I handled very well.
