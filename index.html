      <h4>Personal Contribution</h4>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a preface to the rest of my projects most of
        these projects were made in no more then a week by me and a group of
        others. That being said any small bugs or mistypes/errors are to be
        expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>College Value</b> is definitely the project
        as of now that I take most pride in. College Value was built using React
        on the Front End and we connected to a Java Back End made by one of my
        fellow students.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was personally responsible for the styling
        and functionality of the Navigation Bar, Sign Up, Sign In, Sign Out, and
        much more. In this project I demonstrate my understanding of protected
        routes, authentication, and the Front End proccess.

      <h4>Personal Contribution</h4>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>How To - life hacks</b> is also a project I
        take good pride in. Mostly because I built an entire nodeJS backend
        entirely by myself and from scratch. Of course this project posed
        challenges of its own but this project has proven to be one of if not my
        best learning experience so far.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was personally responsible for the entire
        backend. So I made endpoints for logging in, logging out and creating
        posts, as well as a couple other smaller things which can be found on
        the site found below.

      </a>
      <h4>Personal Contribution</h4>

      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Guidr</b> is one of those projects that I am
        a little less excited to show only because we had a lot of team members
        so I wouldn't want you to receive the wrong impression of my code.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My specific code in my branch is linked below
        so you can always check there for specifics. In general I contributed to
        this project with styling, login and signup functionality, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three specifics things I wanted to
        highlight were that one this idea was very new so new ideas were
        essential and I was involved in the beginning discussion of what this
        app could be. Two we had no one available to do the UI/UX so me and one
        other team member stepped up and spent late nights writing code and then
        completing the UI/UX needs. Finally three, probaly most important,
        teamwork. At that current time I had never worked with a group that
        large which was a fun and interesting challenge which I feel I handled
        very well.

      <h3>Personal Bio</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My code journey started with just a genuine
        interest in computers and how they work. When I realized software
        development was something I could do I never looked back. I did not want
        to jump blind in so I did a lot of research like I mean A LOT.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My initial plan was to be self taught. That
        worked for a while and I learned a lot, working on my own was no
        problem. Then I realized there is almost no way someone is not teaching
        this and my time could be better spent just learning instead of having
        to figure out what to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I found a coding bootcamp called
        Lambda School. Within a few days I was blown away with their track
        record and signed up. I enrolled in the Full Stack Web Development
        course and let me tell you. Never have I ever learned so much so fast. I
        spent 5 days a week for months learning code, talking about code, and
        essentially becoming a web developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im glad I found Lambda. If it wasnt for Lambda I
        may have never became a Full Stack Developer. Lambda taught me how to
        work in team and communicate. They taught me version control and how to
        learn from others. Throughout my Lambda journey I worked in my groups
        both small and big. I also had a daily standup of what I achieved that
        day and what we were to expect for the rest of the day. I beleive this
        has prepared me for just about any workplace.
